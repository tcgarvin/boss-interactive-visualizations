# Impress Your Boss with Interactive Visualizations

This repo contains a deck and resources for a presentation I gave at CodeMash 2020.

- **/d3** - Quick and Dirty d3 code.  Run by loading up index.html.  Not sure if local serving will work, may need to `python3 -m SimpleHTTPServer` or something to view.

- **/data** - Some data generators to create the fake workitems used in the examples

- **/deck** - An export from slides.com of my deck.  [Also hosted at slides.com](https://slides.com/timgarvin/boss-vis)

- **/jupyter** - Quick and dirty example of Jupyter usage, including a line chart or two.

- **/streamlit** - Quick and dirty example of using streamlit.
